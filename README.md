# Mars_Weather
In part_1_mars_news I used BeautifulSoup to scrape data from a mars news wesbite.
	The code finds all title and teser classes and stores them in a dictionary
 	I appeneded entries into a list and displayed them

In part2_mars_weather I scraped the facts page from the Mars website
	I stored all values into an organized list that was fed into a pandas dataframe
 	We plotted the data to find the coldest months and pressure variations by month
	Data exported can be found in the Data folder
